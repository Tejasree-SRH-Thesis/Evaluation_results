# Evaluation_results of Automated Metadata Extraction App

This project introduces an automated system for extracting academic metadata from scientific documents using small-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) with fewer than 3 billion parameters. The solution leverages instruction-tuned models like Phi-3.5 and Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF, Llama3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF,Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct,Gemma2-2B-IT and is deployed through an interactive Gradio web interface that allows users to upload documents, view extracted metadata, and validate results in real time. Our findings show that small LLMs can achieve metadata extraction performance comparable to traditional NLP methods, while requiring significantly less computational resources. This project aims to enhance the efficiency, scalability, and accessibility of academic metadata management across diverse publication formats by combining state-of-the-art AI with an intuitive user experience.

### Process
Here, we present the evaluation results of the aforementioned models in terms of accuracy, completeness, and relevance, based on human evaluation. Each model-generated answer was rated on a scale of 1 to 10.

### Note
The extracted metadata of PDFs can also be viewed on model basis in `Results_all20files folder`.
